# Getting Started with Amalgam

This document will guide you through using Amalgam to cover the core features, along with an overview of its additional features.

Before you begin, take into consideration that Amalgam is a streamlined gamebaseâ€”designed to provide only the base essentials needed for a good roleplaying experience

While it includes a few extras beyond the essentials, the gamebase remains minimal and raw by designâ€”anything outside the core is intentionally left for you to develop

Some experience with GLua is recommended to fully utilize Amalgamâ€™s capabilities. If you're unfamiliar with customizing a gamebase to fit your needs, Amalgam may not be suited for you.

## Amalgam's Addon

While not strictly required, it is highly recommended to download the Amalgam content addon to ensure proper behavior and functionality of the gamebase.  
Installing the content is especially important before launching Amalgam for the first time to avoid missing assets or issues.

## Gamemode Display Name

By default, when launching your gamemode, your server will appear in the server list under Amalgam's default name: `Amalgam: Base`.  
You can change this by editing the following file:
```BASH
ðŸ“‚amalgam/gamemode/shared.lua
```
Locate and modify this variable:
```BASH
GM.Name = "Your Gamemode Name"
```

## Setting Up Your Server
Amalgam requires a MySQL database to function properly. Setting up and configuring MySQL is mandatoryâ€”without it, the gamebase will not operate.

First, you must install the `mysqloo` library on your server.  
Follow the instructions to select the correct `.dll` file based on your serverâ€™s operating system.  
Most servers require the **Windows (32-bit)** version.

You can download it from the official repository:
https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO

To set up your database, enter your MySQL details in the following file:
```BASH
ðŸ“‚amalgam/gamemode/core/sv_database.lua
```

*Example Configuration:*
```lua
local Database = {
    Connected = false,
    Queue = {},
    Config = {
        SQLHost = "1.2.3.4", -- IP
        SQLUser = "username", -- Username
        SQLPassword = "password", -- Password
        SQLDB = "database", -- Database Name
        SQLPort = 3306 -- MySQL port is 3306 by standard. DO NOT change it unless you know what you are doing!
    }
}
```
## Adding New Columns
Amalgamâ€™s database system is highly flexible, allowing developers to easily add and manage custom player data fields.
The process is very simpleâ€”but only if you understand what you're doing
**Do keep in mind: 
> You donâ€™t need to fully understand how the Amalgam database file works. But you **must** understand **basic SQL** and how **NetworkVars** function in Garryâ€™s Mod.

### How to Safely Add Columns

Amalgamâ€™s MySQL system will automatically manage any new fields added to `Amalgam.PlayerTable`.  
However, to ensure stability and proper integration, follow these rules:

---

To safely add new columns to `Amalgam.PlayerTable`, follow this structured guide to avoid breaking the framework:

> â€¢ **Data Type** â€” Use appropriate SQL types like `VARCHAR(100)`, `INT`, or `TINYINT`. Match types to the intended data.  
> â€¢ **Network Vars** â€” Only add a corresponding entry in `Amalgam.NetworkVars` if the data must be sent to the client.  
> â€¢ **Structure** â€” Maintain the same format used by existing columns. The key structure must be consistent and error-free.  

> âš  Incorrect formatting or missing default fields can cause the database to fail, making the game inaccessible

---

#### Developer Insight
> Not all data needs to be networked. For example, `ToolTrust`, `Registered` and `WatchedIntro ` are handled strictly server-side.  
> Only fields required for UI display or client functionality should be added to `Amalgam.NetworkVars`.  
> Evaluate your feature needs â€” **you control which data flows to the client**.
---

If you're unsure about any of the above:
> **Do not modify** the database tables or this module.  
> Any mistake may result in complete failure of the framework or block access to the gamemode.
