# Server Management Module
Amalgam includes a powerful built-in hierarchical management system with a UNIX-styled terminal interface for seamless command integration and server administration.
Unlike traditional addons, Amalgam handles management differently, using a secure, terminal-driven approach instead of standard UI menus. This section explains how to operate and manage your server using Amalgam.

Amalgam includes a powerful built-in hierarchical server management system that manages administration through a secure, in-game terminal‚Äîbypassing traditional UI and ensuring direct, controlled command execution.
This section explains how to operate and manage this module, including the role hierarchy system and how to configure your Root User access.

Amalgam‚Äôs Server Management Module is a hierarchical integrated system designed to handle administration through a secure, terminal-based interface. All commands are executed directly via the in-game terminal, providing controlled access to server functions without relying on traditional UI elements.

## Rank Hierarchy & Privilege Inheritance

Amalgam‚Äôs permission and moderation system is defined by a strict rank-based hierarchy. All administrative logic is handled via:
```BASH
üìÇamalgam/gamemode/security/moderation.lua
```

This file outlines how each rank is granted privileges and how those privileges propagate through the system.

### Understanding Privilege Inheritance

Amalgam uses **hierarchical inheritance** to determine access levels. This means that any permission granted to a specific rank will be automatically inherited by all **higher** ranks in the hierarchy.

For example:
- Granting access to `"Moderator"` will also allow `"Administrator"` and `"RootUser"` to inherit the same privilege.
- Restricting access to a privilage to `"Administrator"` only means `"Moderator"` will not inherit it ‚Äî only `"Administrator"` and `"RootUser"` can use it.

To apply inherited privileges, always use:
```lua
meta:HasRank("RankName")
```
To enforce exclusive access to a single rank (with no inheritance), use:
``` lua
meta:Rank() == "RankName"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è***Important: Never use meta:GetRank() for permission checks. It is for display only and does not pull data from the server-side database.
Use meta:HasRank() or meta:Rank() for all critical logic to avoid exploit vulnerabilities.***

Example Use Cases:

```lua
-- Inherited privilege
if (ply:HasRank("Moderator")) then
    -- Will apply to Moderator, Administrator, and RootUser
end

-- Exclusive to Event Coordinator only
if (ply:Rank() == "EventCoordinator") then
    -- Will NOT be inherited by higher ranks
end
```

## Rank Hierarchy Table

```BASH
| Rank              | Power Level | Inherits From     | Notes                                      |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `User`            | 1           | _None_            | Default rank for all players               |
| `EventCoordinator`| 2           | User              | Useful for granting isolated access        |
| `Moderator`       | 3           | EventCoordinator  | Lowest level of admin powers               |
| `Administrator`   | 4           | Moderator         | Full administrative access                 |
| `RootUser`        | 5           | Administrator     | Top-level superuser with absolute control  |
```

## A-Shell Interface
The A-Shell Terminal is the central administrative tool in Amalgam, offering a secure and structured interface for managing the server. Through the terminal, you can:

* Execute built-in commands for real-time server control
* Access system logs and debugging utilities  
* Perform sensitive administrative actions with verified permissions

### Accesiability
A-Shell is secured through exclusive network channels, ensuring that only players with the appropriate rank can execute commands within its interface.
While primarily intended as an administrative tool, it also supports user-level functions that may serve useful purposes during gameplay.

By default, all players can open the terminal. However, command execution is strictly governed by rank‚Äîunless a command is intentionally configured to allow access without rank requirements, in which case it may be used by any player.
Refer to the section `Adding A-Shell Commands` below for guidance on securely registering and protecting your commands.

To access the terminal, simply press F1.

## Root-User Initialization
The Root User role grants the highest level of control within the Amalgam gamebase. It is reserved for the server‚Äôs master operator and overrides all other administrative ranks.
There are two ways to initialize yourself as the Root User:

### $claimroot (The Secure Method)
The safest way to assign yourself as Root User is by using the built-in $claimroot command.

How It Works:
On first startup, if no Root User exists, Amalgam generates a one-time password in:
```BASH
data/amalgam/amalgam_root.txt
```
Open the file, copy the password, and enter the following command in the terminal:

```BASH
$claimroot <password>
```
If the password is correct, you will be given the 'Root User' giving you limitless restrictions and full control over the server

Why This Is Secure:
* Prevents unauthorized players from claiming Root User.
* Ensures only the first person with file access can take control.
* Amalgam will permanently deletes the password file and will not generate a password anymore
* Once claimed, $claimroot is permanently disabled, preventing abuse.

### Direct Database Modification (Not Secure)
You may manually assign yourself a rank by editing the database directly; however, **this method is strongly discouraged**. Doing so does not disable the $claimroot feature, meaning the server will still assume no Root User exists. This creates a serious security risk, as new root passwords will continue to be generated, and the root claim process will remain accessible.
Anyone with access to the server could potentially execute $claimroot and gain unauthorized Root access, allowing them to take full control of the server and maliciously exploit its systems.

## Adding New A-Shell Commands
Amalgam‚Äôs A-Shell terminal allows for the creation of custom commands using a structured blueprint function. These commands follow a strict definition format and are governed by the rank-based permission system, preventing unauthorized usage‚Äîunless explicitly configured to allow it.

Command File Location
All A-Shell commands are stored in:
```BASH
üìÇamalgam/gamemode/sh_commands.lua
```

### Using 'Amalgam.RegisterCommand'
To register a new terminal command, use the built-in Amalgam.RegisterCommand function. This function allows you to define the command behavior, who can use it, and what arguments it requires.

### `Amalgam.RegisterCommand` Parameters
```BASH
| Parameter        | Type         | Required | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | `string`     | ‚úÖ       | The command name (without the `$` prefix).                                 |
| `description`    | `string`     | ‚úÖ       | A short summary of what the command does.                                  |
| `callback`       | `function`   | ‚úÖ       | Function that is executed when the command is run.                         |
| `requiredRank`   | `string`/`nil`| ‚ùå      | Minimum rank required to run the command. `nil` allows public access.      |
| `requiredArgs`   | `table`/`nil`| ‚ùå       | List of expected argument names (shown in help and used for validation).   |
| `isHidden`       | `boolean`    | ‚ùå       | If `true`, hides the command from the `$help` list.                        |
```

**Example: Creating a Moderator Command**
```lua
Amalgam.RegisterCommand("kick", "Kick a player from the server", function(ply, target, reason)
    if (SERVER) then
        local targ = ply:FindPlayer(target)
        if (not IsValid(targ)) then
            Amalgam.SendToClient(ply, "[Error] Player not found!", "error")
            return
        end
        targ:Kick(reason)
        Amalgam.BroadcastHistory("[Admin] " .. target .. " was kicked for: " .. reason, "admin")
    end
end, "Moderator", {"player", "reason"})
```
* This command can only be executed by users with the **"Moderator"** rank or higher (e.g., Administrator, RootUser)
* The `{"player", "reason"}` argument list ensures both a valid **target** and **reason** must be provided when executing the command
*  If any required argument is missing, the terminal will return an automatic error:  
> `"[Error] Missing argument: player"` or `"reason"` depending on what was omitted
