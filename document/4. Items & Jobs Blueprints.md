# Jobs & Items

Amalgam utilizes an OOP-inspired blueprinting system in its core modules to simplify the creation of modular content.  
Both **Jobs** and **Items** follow a similar structure, making them easy to define, register, and extend using a consistent pattern.

Jobs are handled in the core file:
```BASH
ðŸ“‚amalgam/gamemode/core/sh_jobs.lua
```
Items are managed by the inventory system in:
```BASH
ðŸ“‚amalgam/gamemode/core/sh_inventory.lua
```

You can technically define new job or item blueprints anywhere in the gamebase, as long as the file is within the shared realm (sh_).
However, itâ€™s recommended to define blueprints in their appropriate locations for clarity and consistency:

Jobs:
```BASH
ðŸ“‚amalgam/gamemode/sh_jobs.lua
```

Items:
```BASH
ðŸ“‚amalgam/gamemode/sh_items.lua
```

You're also free to define blueprints in custom modules, provided they follow the shared realm requirement.

## Blueprint Structure

Items and Jobs require different sets of values to function correctly.
Follow the templates below to define new blueprints properly:

Job Blueprint Template
```lua
Amalgam.JobBlueprint({
	-- Unique identifier for this job
	-- Must be a unique string. Job blueprints cannot share the same UniqueID.
	UniqueID = "Unique_Job_ID",

	-- The display name of the job. Appears in UI.
	Name = "Job Name",

	-- A short description shown in the UI, explaining what this job does.
	Description = "Job Description.",

	-- The player model(s) used by this job.
	-- Accepts a single string (one model) or a table of strings (multiple options).
	Model = "models/player/example.mdl", -- or { "models/player/one.mdl", "models/player/two.mdl" }

	-- (OPTIONAL) Bodygroups to apply when the player becomes this job.
	-- Format: [bodygroupIndex] = value
	-- Can be omitted if not needed.
	BodyGroups = {
	  [0] = 1,
	  [1] = 2
	},

	-- (OPTIONAL) Maximum number of players allowed in this job at once.
	-- If omitted, the job has unlimited slots.
	-- Enforced in real-time during job selection.
	MaxSlots = 3,

	-- (OPTIONAL) The amount of money this job generates for the player on a recurring timer.
	-- If omitted, the player will not earn passive income from this job.
	Income = 50,

	-- (OPTIONAL) A function that runs when a player switches to this job.
	-- Ideal for applying job-specific logic, such as giving weapons or gear.
	-- If not provided, a default empty function will be used.
	JobFunc = function(ply)
	  -- Example:
	  -- ply:Give("weapon_pistol")
	  -- ply:ChatPrint("Welcome to the force, Officer!")
end
 ```

Item Blueprint Template
```lua
Amalgam.ItemBlueprint({
	-- Unique identifier for this item
	-- Must be a unique string. item blueprints cannot share the same UniqueID.
    UniqueID = "item_id",

    -- The display name of the item. Appears in UI.
    Name = "Item Name",

    -- Short description displayed in the UI to provide additional context.
    Description = "Item Description",

    -- Model path used both for UI display and physical representation.
    Model = "models/items/healthkit.mdl",

    -- Item weight, used in the inventory system to enhance immersion
    Weight = 1,

    -- (OPTIONAL) Custom action assigned to the item.
    -- Right-clicking opens a context menu with all available actions.
    -- You can define multiple actions, but itâ€™s recommended to keep it under 5.
    -- The first string represents the label shown in the menu.
    Use = function(self, ply)
        ply:SetHealth(math.min(ply:Health() + 5, ply:GetMaxHealth()))
        ply:RemoveItem(self.UniqueID, 1) 
    end
})
